        <h2>Our Mission</h2>
        <p>Our journey started on the court. We saw a need for a single, unified platform where players could connect, compete, and improve. We got tired of juggling different apps for finding matches, booking courts, and tracking our progress. So, we decided to build it ourselves.</p>
        <p>PadelUp is our answer. Itâ€™s more than just an app; it's a community hub designed by players, for players. Our mission is to make padel more accessible, competitive, and fun for everyone, from the first-time player to the seasoned pro.</p>

            <li>
                <strong>Community First:</strong> We believe the heart of padel is its community. Our goal is to build a platform that fosters connections, sportsmanship, and friendship.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Seamless Technology:</strong> Your time should be spent on the court, not on your phone. We're obsessed with creating a smooth, intuitive experience that gets you playing faster.
